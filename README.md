# AIConnect4

This project involves creating an automated Connect 4 bot that uses the minimax and alpha-beta pruning algorithms to play and win the game. The complete project report provides detailed insights and analysis.

### Overview
- The project was awarded a perfect score (10/10) in the AI: Principles & Techniques (SOW-BKI259) course.
- Implemented minimax algorithm with and without alpha-beta pruning in Java to create an automated bot that plays Connect 4 against a human player.
- Analyzed, compared, and tested the implementations, with detailed documentation in the project report.

### Features
- **Minimax Algorithm**: Implements a decision-making algorithm for optimal moves.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Enhances the minimax algorithm to improve efficiency.
