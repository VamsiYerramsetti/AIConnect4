# AIConnect4
Automated Connect 4 bot which plays using the minimax and alpha beta pruning algorithms to win.
The project report PDF gives a complete insight and breakdown of the project.
Code is on master branch.

This Project was awarded a 10/10 by the AI: Principles & Techniques (SOW-BKI259) course teaching team.
Tim and I were asked to implement the minimax algorithm with and without alpha-beta prunning into an automated bot which plays Connect4 against a human in java.
We then analysed, compared and tested the results of our implmentation. We documented the whole process in our project report PDF.
